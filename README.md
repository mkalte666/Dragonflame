# Dragonflame
An IRCBot written in Python

### What is this?
I always wonderd why people use irssi and perl to build IRC Bots. 
Today I was bored so I created Dragonflame: An IRCBot that only uses the standard library of Python!

### How to Use?
In the Dragonflame.py change the server settings, nickname, channelname, ... to things you need/want and run it!
You can either edit Dragonflame.py to add (LoadModule(name)) modules or you can do it at runtime via the "load <name>" command.
Stopping the bot can be done by entering CTRL-C
